## Overview

HorseshowPro is an online/web-app tool for managing 4H Horse Shows.  I grew up
with horses and rode in 4H and the show process remains mostly arcaic to this
day.  Since many of my family members now do the same and manage the process
this project was started to help bring some technology to bear on the problem.

## Goals
The following goals were set for the current version:
* Provide a streamlined way to handle multiple shows, riders, entries and
  results
* Reduce paperwork by doing much of the data-entry in an app as opposed to
  using paper at the show.
* Improve the output of the show by providing comments and historical data
  to riders, helping them to improve.
* Streamline the show process by automating the required reporting for 
  the various show awards.  Eliminate common human errors.
* Provide for alternate input methods during the show (tablet) to further
  reduce paper waste

## Future
There are many ways this could be further improved:
* Provide an online means of entering orders thus further streamlining
  the entry process
* Integrate social network updates where requested
* Help with fees, budgeting and journal entry (still a largly manual process)
